Content of this college-level course corresponds to the syllabus of the College Board Advanced Placement Program for Computer Science A.  Students will design software to solve problems and use data structures, such as classes and arrays, to represent information within a program.  Students will also gain a working knowledge of the major hardware and software components of computer systems.  Java is the main vehicle for implementing solutions to problems.  All students are required to take the Advanced Placement exam.\nTJ: This course is a standard second-semester college course on algorithms and data structures in an object-oriented environment.  The sorting algorithms studied include selection, insertion, merge, quick, and heap.   The data structures studied include arrays, array lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, maps, and graphs.  Additional topics include recursion, the Java Collections framework, Big-O analysis, and class design.  The programming language is Java.  Students taking this course should be independent thinkers able to spend a significant amount of time at a computer outside of class.  Approximately 75% of the time is spent learning material that is above and beyond the material on the AP Computer Science A exam, which all enrolled students are required to take.",

The course is designed with two purposes in mind. First, it provides the content and skills foundation for the entire scientific program at the school. In particular, the Biology curriculum prepares students for the Advance Placement (AP) Biology course. Second, the course represents one element of IBET that links these distinctive disciplines so that scientific concepts, language arts, and engineering innovation are seamlessly woven together in a way that is realistic and relevant to students. As such, the Biology course demonstrates cohesive horizontal articulation (including the constraints of the unique integrated project work done by each team) among the various Biology classes, while also targeting vertical articulation in support of upper-class courses. Each IBET team requires the development of a year-long research project designed and conducted by students in small groups. Collaboration is stressed to prepare students for increased demands by industry for strong interpersonal skills as well as technical competencies. The Fairfax County Public Schools Family Life Education (FLE) instruction occurs at the end of the school year.

Offered as an elective option aimed at 9th and 10th graders to complete their 4th social studies credit, the course will serve as a foundational course that purports to introduce students to research and analytical skills needed in the upper level courses.In terms of content, the course will explore the increasingly interconnected history of major civilizations and other forms of complex societies that arose in pre-classical through post-classical era Afro-Eurasia, focusing on comparative analysis of the sociopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural traditions and innovations that developed in these ancient societies as well as the webs of communication and exchange that connected these societies spatially and temporally. Investigations of cultural traditions will emphasize the development of scientific and technological breakthroughs and innovations, trace the means and routes by which they spread beyond the society in which they emerged, and the regional and cross-regional impact they wielded on the increasingly interconnected pre-modern world. In specific terms, the civilizations studied in the course will range from Mesopotamia and Egypt in the ancient world, to Greece, Rome, Persia, China, and India in the classical world, to the fall of Rome and the rise of the Islamic world in the early-post-classical world.As a foundational course focusing on inquiry learning and the development of higher order thinking, reading, and writing skills, a heavy emphasis will be based on analyzing and evaluating various types of primary and secondary sources. The course will culminate with a final research project that will integrate these skills and focus on the larger themes of the course.",

This is taught within the context of the Autodesk program Inventor. Unlike previous CAD programs such as AutoCAD, Inventor is a parametric CAD program. What that means is the dimensions, shape, and other key factors in the design are controlled by variables which can be changed at any time, even after the design is complete. In effect, when you design an object in a parametric CAD program you are creating not one design but a whole family of related designs. In the simplest example one can draw a hexagonal nut, change two dimensions and a hole parameter and it will become any hexagonal nut. Change another parameter and it will become a square nut. For increased complexity one can design a generic internal combustion engine.",

Students will examine and critically analyze major artworks from the past and present, within a variety of cultures. These include a chronology from Paleolithic art through the present. While the emphasis will be on Western Art traditions, a minimum of 20% of the course comes from beyond the European tradition. As the name implies, art history is the study of art and the study of history. While a visual analysis (formal critique) is emphasized, the cultural context, history, politics, religion, patronage, gender issues, function, effect and audience of each work are crucial to the study of art history. Art history is based not primarily on memorization of facts, but rather on specific historical contexts shaped by the forces of time, place, events, culture, social change, and the activities of individual artists and patrons. In this course works of art are viewed as products of specific times and places.",

Students study the literary techniques used by Roman authors by reading Latin poetry and prose with historical and literary sensitivity. Students are encouraged to develop linguistic skills by engaging in multiple activities, including translating poetry and prose from the required-reading list, precisely and literally; reading passages of poetry and prose with comprehension; and analyzing literary texts in clear, coherent written arguments, supported by textual examples. All students are required to take the Advanced Placement Latin exam.\nTJ: The Aeneid is a 10,000 line epic poem, divided into 12 books. The Latin students at Thomas Jefferson will read the entire poem in English, and 1856 lines in Latin, in accordance with the AP Latin Syllabus published by the College Board. While students will use grammatical structures as an aid/tool to understanding the Latin, and continue learning essential Latin vocabulary to facilitate translating, they will also be analyzing the poem as literature. Therefore, students will be able to scan the Latin lines and read the Aeneid aloud in meter, and will be able to analyze Vergil's use of figures of speech, relating them to English poetry. In addition, students will read and react to scholarly articles about the poem/author and investigate some of the many websites geared for the classics student. During the course of their study, students will learn about the life of Vergil and his place in the Age of Augustus as well as the mythology of the Trojan War. In May, students will be fully prepared to take the AP Latin Exam.",

They express ideas accurately and resourcefully, both orally and in writing, with reasonable fluency, and they develop a vocabulary sufficiently ample for reading newspaper and magazine articles, contemporary literature, and other nontechnical writings.  They receive extensive training in the organization and writing of compositions, review syntax, and study selected works by contemporary authors.  Materials will include recordings, films, newspapers, and magazines.  All students are required to take the Advanced Placement Japanese Language exam.\nTJ: Students study the use of language for active communication, specifically: the ability to understand the spoken target language in both formal and conversational situations; the ability to express ideas accurately and resourcefully, both orally and in writing with reasonable fluency; the development of a vocabulary sufficient for reading newspaper and magazine articles, contemporary literature, and other writings; extensive training in the organization and writing of compositions; an in-depth review of grammar; and the study of chosen works by contemporary writers.
