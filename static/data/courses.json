This is taught within the context of the Autodesk program Inventor. Unlike previous CAD programs such as AutoCAD, Inventor is a parametric CAD program. What that means is the dimensions, shape, and other key factors in the design are controlled by variables which can be changed at any time, even after the design is complete. In effect, when you design an object in a parametric CAD program you are creating not one design but a whole family of related designs. In the simplest example one can draw a hexagonal nut, change two dimensions and a hole parameter and it will become any hexagonal nut. Change another parameter and it will become a square nut. For increased complexity one can design a generic internal combustion engine.",

Offered as an elective option aimed at 9th and 10th graders to complete their 4th social studies credit, the course will serve as a foundational course that purports to introduce students to research and analytical skills needed in the upper level courses. In terms of content, the course will explore the increasingly interconnected history of major civilizations and other forms of complex societies that arose in pre-classical through post-classical era Afro-Eurasia, focusing on comparative analysis of the sociopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural traditions and innovations that developed in these ancient societies as well as the webs of communication and exchange that connected these societies spatially and temporally. Investigations of cultural traditions will emphasize the development of scientific and technological breakthroughs and innovations, trace the means and routes by which they spread beyond the society in which they emerged, and the regional and cross-regional impact they wielded on the increasingly interconnected pre-modern world. In specific terms, the civilizations studied in the course will range from Mesopotamia and Egypt in the ancient world, to Greece, Rome, Persia, China, and India in the classical world, to the fall of Rome and the rise of the Islamic world in the early-post-classical world. As a foundational course focusing on inquiry learning and the development of higher order thinking, reading, and writing skills, a heavy emphasis will be based on analyzing and evaluating various types of primary and secondary sources. The course will culminate with a final research project that will integrate these skills and focus on the larger themes of the course.",

The course will function as a readings seminar. In each unit, students will read, discuss, and present on articles from periodicals such as Current History, Foreign Affairs, Atlantic Monthly, and major newspapers.

The concept of a rigorous proof is extended in this class, and students learn not only how to do specific problems but also why these techniques work and the logic underlying the techniques. Complex integration is then introduced, and the famous Cauchy Theorem, along with many of its implications, is explored. Topics include series representation of analytic functions, Laurent expansions of meromorphic functions, the calculus of residues, and conformal mappings along with several of their scientific applications especially those involving fluid flow and steady-state temperature distributions. Dual enrollment at GMU is available for this course, but this option is not required.",

The course is designed with two purposes in mind. First, it provides the content and skills foundation for the entire scientific program at the school. In particular, the Biology curriculum prepares students for the Advance Placement (AP) Biology course. Second, the course represents one element of IBET that links these distinctive disciplines so that scientific concepts, language arts, and engineering innovation are seamlessly woven together in a way that is realistic and relevant to students. As such, the Biology course demonstrates cohesive horizontal articulation (including the constraints of the unique integrated project work done by each team) among the various Biology classes, while also targeting vertical articulation in support of upper-class courses. Each IBET team requires the development of a year-long research project designed and conducted by students in small groups. Collaboration is stressed to prepare students for increased demands by industry for strong interpersonal skills as well as technical competencies. The Fairfax County Public Schools Family Life Education (FLE) instruction occurs at the end of the school year.

Students not only learn about the American experience at a survey level, but also investigate primary source documents that give voice to the major ideas of each time period. These texts serve as a springboard for independent, ongoing research. In the English portion of this course, students study a variety of literary texts, including poetry, fiction, exposition, and drama. They discover and compare themes in these texts and use them as the basis for written analysis and discussion. Through varied and frequent writing assignments, students reinforce their understanding of purpose and audience, and develop their ability to control voice and tone. In addition, students study vocabulary, usage, dialect differences, language development and rhetorical principles.

The second half is organized around the study of human society and culture. Through readings, class discussions, presentations, and videos, the class explores what it means to be human. Topics include: similarities and differences among cultures; social and economic characteristics; customs, traditions, taboos, and beliefs; and how anthropology, through its distinctive methods, can clarify our understanding of each other and ourselves. A variety of guest speakers working in the subfields of anthropology enrich the course, and depending on availability may include primatologists, forensic anthropologists, archaeologists, and ethnographers. Emphasis is placed on responsible participation in group and class activities such as team projects, class discussions, reading, writing, and research.",

        "description": "A few years ago, scientists discovered that geckoes can cling to smooth surfaces through the use of Van der Waals interactions between fine hairs on the geckos feet and the surface in question. In 2004 a small company began advertising a new adhesive that relies on the principles learned from studying geckos feet. Bionanotechnology is the relatively new field that focuses on the interface between technology and very small biological systems. The course will be conducted primarily as a seminar, and students will read papers on how biological systems and processes could be adapted for use in todays society. They will be called upon to imagine unique but beneficial uses of adaptations of known biological processes. A good imagination will clearly be an advantage to students taking this course.",

        "description": "Electromagnetic interactions dominate the structure and behavior of systems on earth; from atomic to chemical to nano to biological to geological scales and beyond. 100% of the information humans receive about the world around them is encoded in and transmitted through the electromagnetic field. Building on the foundation of the strong AP Physics-C course, students extend their understanding of Space-Time, Electromagnetic fields and interactions during the first semester,; with an emphasis on dynamic electromagnetic fields and waves starting from Maxwell's Equations in differential and integral form. Einstein's conception of space-time, embodied in Special Relativity, is developed to produce a consistent description of electromagnetic fields, forces, and interactions. Classical electrodynamics, and classical wave optics are developed in a rigorous mathematical treatment. Quantum Mechanics is introduced after winter break in the physical context of Quantum Optics and finite-state systems which brings together fundamental quantum mechanics, electromagnetic fields, and the interaction of photons with matter,. The development includes contemporary research areas and modern applications of quantum mechanics including quantum entanglement, the quantum description of photo production and detection, select topics in solid state physics and nano technology. The last quarter of the course introduces basic concepts in Quantum Computing and Quantum Cryptography, with an attendant examination of fundamental quantum mechanics of entangled states and Bell's theorem. The course ends with a brief description of the structure and physical concepts of the fully relativistic quantum theory: Quantum Electrodynamics. This course is intended for students who enjoyed AP Physics-C and wish to understand the fundamental physics of space-time, electromagnetic fields, and quantum mechanics. Strong quantitative problem solving skills as demonstrated in AP Physics-C and advanced mathematics courses at TJ as well as an eagerness to learn through problem solving are requirements for success in this post-AP course.  Students should plan on spending a minimum of 6 hours per week on homework for the class.",
